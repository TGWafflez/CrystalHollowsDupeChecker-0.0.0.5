Checks items in inventories to see if they were duped as part of the Crystal Hollows Dupe Event in Hypixel Skyblock.

Highlights them in red in your inventory, and adds a lore line "POSSIBLY DUPED".

Uses the originTag ITEM_STASH property to check whether they're duped as part of the Jan 2022 Crystal Hollows dupe.
